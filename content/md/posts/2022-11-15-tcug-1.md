After a long break, it's time to get together again.

In this first gathering we will start from the beginning by
learning some Clojure basics interactively using the REPL.

The only thing you need is some basic programming knowledge
and zeal to learn new things. It's recommended to bring a
laptop but if you don't have one you can pair with someone
that has.

The plan (as always) is to try solve some https://adventofcode.com/
puzzles which are fun and Xmas themed.

If you intend to join (you should! it's free), please contact me 
to reserve a seat, as this is a max 15 person workshop.

Schedule:

1. Coding
2. Pizza
3. Beverage
